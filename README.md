Sensor Lattice Consistency Analysis (SLCA) is a deterministic analytical methodology that evaluates whether a digital artifact is consistent with the physical constraints imposed by real-world sensor acquisition systems.

SLCA does not perform classification of artificial intelligence systems, generative models, or software tools. Instead, it measures whether observable bit-level lattice behavior is compatible with physical capture.

The method operates independently of training data, probabilistic inference, or model attribution.
