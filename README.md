1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents Sensor Lattice Consistency Analysis™ (SLCA), a deterministic, physics-grounded methodology for evaluating whether a digital media artifact is compatible with physical sensor acquisition pipelines.

This repository exists to:

Establish public prior art

Document a repeatable analytical method

Provide a transparent, inspectable technical description

Support forensic, legal, and evidentiary review use cases

This repository does not provide a consumer product, AI classifier, attribution engine, or probabilistic model.

2. Definition of Sensor Lattice Consistency Analysis™ (SLCA)

Sensor Lattice Consistency Analysis™ (SLCA) is a deterministic analytical method that evaluates whether observable bit-level and spatial lattice behavior within a digital artifact is consistent with the physical constraints imposed by real-world sensor acquisition systems.

The method operates by:

Reducing digital media to bit-level lattice representations

Measuring distributional and structural consistency

Comparing extracted signatures against physically derived reference baselines

Evaluating compatibility, not authorship or intent

SLCA does not attempt to identify specific artificial intelligence models, software tools, or creators.

3. What SLCA Is Not

To avoid ambiguity, SLCA explicitly does not:

Classify “AI vs human” authorship

Perform machine learning or adaptive inference

Depend on training datasets

Assert identity, intent, or provenance

Make probabilistic claims

SLCA evaluates physical compatibility only.

4. Technical Characteristics

The SLCA methodology is defined by the following properties:

Deterministic: Identical inputs yield identical outputs

Repeatable: Independent implementations produce equivalent results

Explainable: All steps are mathematically and physically inspectable

Model-independent: No reliance on neural networks or learned weights

Sensor-grounded: Anchored in real-world acquisition physics

These characteristics are intentional and required for forensic admissibility.

5. Intended Applications

SLCA is designed for use in contexts where explainability and repeatability are mandatory, including but not limited to:

Digital forensics

Evidentiary review

Expert testimony

Media authentication analysis

Chain-of-custody evaluation

Technical affidavits

The methodology is suitable for environments governed by standards such as Daubert and similar evidentiary frameworks.
